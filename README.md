# snake-deeplearning
Introduction to deeplearning playing the snake game

There are two `main` classes in the project.

Run `DeeplearningSnakeController` to train the deeplearning Snake controller.

Run `SnakeJavafxApp` to run the GUI and watch the trained Snake controller.

Next versions will contain a nice GUI so you can train and run different controllers.

To simplify running the application in JavaFX this project needs to be compiled and run with Java 8.
